### Reflection
<p>
  From this industrial talk, I have learned about the skills needed if I wish to work in the ICT field in the future. I would like to say thank you to the speakers from Clarity Techworks
  for their faithful advice for us so that we can understand more about how it is to work in the ICT field. For example, different speakers of different positions talked about the job scope
  of different positions so that we could be clearer on what we want to do in the future. 
</p>
<p>The speakers also mentioned important skills such as being an independent learner because technology is always changing, so we need to be prepared and continuously learn new things
  and adapt to the changes in technology. I have learned that being a student will be very different from working, and I will always improve myself and get prepared for the working environment.</p>
